# LinguaLink-New: Expert Design Brief (Redesign 2026)
## Target: Phase 1 Core Architecture

### 🌍 Project Context: The Mission
LinguaLink-New is not just another social media or language learning app; it is a **Digital Heritage Vault**. Its purpose is to preserve dying or underrepresented languages by turning native speakers into "Cultural Guardians." The app incentivizes users to record their voices, tell ancestral stories, and participate in real-time bilingual communication.

### 🎨 Design Philosophy: "The Future of Tradition"
The visual identity should represent a bridge between **Ancestral Roots** and **Cutting-Edge AI**. 
- **The Vibe:** Premium, high-trust, vibrant, and alive. 
- **The User:** Ranging from tech-savvy diaspora youth wanting to connect with their roots, to elders in remote regions sharing wisdom. 
- **The Core Hook:** AI as the invisible translator that makes everyone's voice understood worldwide.

**STITCH: Use the following breakdown to redesign the core experience while staying anchored in this mission of "Preserving the Past with the Tools of the Future." You have 100% creative autonomy.**
