# LinguaLink-New: Design Inspiration & Content Guide
## Phase 1: Core Experience Screens

This document serves as a "Creative Brief" for the redesign. It strips away technical jargon and focuses on the **Content, Emotion, and Interactive Elements** of each screen. This allows for maximum creativity in the visual redesign (Vibe: Premium, Vibrant, Cultural, Modern).

---

### 1. Welcome Screen (The First Impression)
* **Goal:** To make the user feel like they are entering a global village of voices.
* **Essential Content:**
    * **Brand Hero:** App title "LinguaLink AI" and the core mission: "Preserving languages, one voice at a time."
    * **Hook:** A tagline about AI-powered storytelling and cultural preservation.
    * **Feature Highlights:**
        * Share Your Voice (Audio storytelling)
        * Create AI Stories (Visual synthesis)
        * Preserve Culture (Education/Heritage)
        * Earn & Learn (Gamification)
    * **Action Center:** A primary button to "Get Started" and a secondary "Sign In" link.
* **Design Creative Direction:** Use vibrant gradients and perhaps a subtle "soundwave" or "global pulse" animation. The design should feel warm and inviting, not clinical.

### 2. Enhanced Home Screen (The Heartbeat)
* **Goal:** A dynamic, living feed of global human expression.
* **Essential Content:**
    * **Feed Navigation:** Tabs for "Following", "Discover", "Trending", and "Live".
    * **The Media Card (The Core Component):**
        * **Voice Clips:** Should display the speaker's name, language, time ago, and a "soundwave" representing the audio.
        * **Video Stories:** Immersive thumbnails.
        * **Context:** The phrase or story title.
        * **Engagement Suite:** Like/Heart, "Validate" (a unique feature for language learners to verify accuracy), Repost, and Share.
    * **Live Indicator:** A horizontal strip showing ongoing "Live" language rooms.
* **Design Creative Direction:** Focus on "Media-First". The feed should feel smooth (Glassmorphism or clean depth). Animations for playback should be micro-interactive.

### 3. Chat List Screen (The Social Hub)
* **Goal:** A clean, organized view of all personal connections.
* **Essential Content:**
    * **Quick Access:** A horizontal "Stories" bar at the top with user avatars.
    * **Search & Filter:** Easily find contacts or groups.
    * **The Interaction List:**
        * User Avatars with active/away status indicators.
        * Last message preview + unread badge.
        * Typing indicators (real-time).
    * **Call Actions:** Quick access to recent calls or contacts.
* **Design Creative Direction:** Focus on perfect typography and "Air" (white space). Use subtle shadows to separate conversation threads.

### 4. Chat Detail Screen (Real-Time Connection)
* **Goal:** To make cross-language communication feel effortless.
* **Essential Content:**
    * **The Conversation:** Distinct bubble styles for "Me" (the sender) and "Them" (the receiver).
    * **AI Magic:** Integrated "Translate" toggle. When active, it shows the original text + the translated version within the bubble.
    * **Voice Messaging:** Inline audio players for voice notes.
    * **Input Bar:** Multimodal options—Text, Voice (Record button), Image/Media pickers, and Call triggers (Voice/Video).
* **Design Creative Direction:** The "AI Translation" should feel premium—maybe a subtle shimmer or color shift when a message is translated.

### 5. Profile Screen (The Identity)
* **Goal:** A digital museum of the user's cultural and linguistic contributions.
* **Essential Content:**
    * **Hero Header:** Avatar, Name, Username, and a Bio.
    * **Stats Row:** Count of Followers, Following, and Clips contributed.
    * **Language Badges:** Display which languages the user speaks or is learning.
    * **The Gallery:** A tabbed view of "My Clips" (audio/video) and "Saved Stories".
    * **CTAs:** "Edit Profile" and "Settings" access.
* **Design Creative Direction:** Editorial feel. Large typography for the name, elegant grid for the media gallery.

### 6. Library Screen (The Archive)
* **Goal:** A professional workspace for managing content.
* **Essential Content:**
    * **Asset Tabs:** Voice, Video, and Stories.
    * **The Asset Item:** Title, Date, Language, and Duration.
    * **Management:** Play, Edit, and Delete controls.
    * **Floating Action:** A prominent "Record New" button.
* **Design Creative Direction:** Functional but sleek. Card-based layout with easy swipe-to-edit gestures.

### 7. SignUp Screen (The Portal)
* **Goal:** A friction-less entry that feels like a ceremony.
* **Essential Content:**
    * **Personal Info:** Full Name, Username (with real-time availability check).
    * **Security:** Email and Password.
    * **Linguistic Data:** Primary Language selection and Home Location (Region/Tribe).
    * **Referral:** "Invite Code" optional field.
* **Design Creative Direction:** Stepped or Progressive Disclosure design. Don't show all fields at once to avoid overwhelm. Use large, friendly inputs.

### 8. SignIn Screen (The Re-Entry)

* **Essential Content:**
    * **Credentials:** Email and Password.
    * **Password Recovery:** "Forgot Password?" link.
    * **Third-Party:** "Continue with Google" button.
* **Design Creative Direction:** Clean, centered, and minimal. High contrast for buttons.

### 9. Interest Selection Screen (The Curator)

    * **Categories:** Languages, Topics (Culture, Music, Tech), and Regions.
    * **Interaction:** Checkboxes or selectable "pills/bubbles" that pop or glow when selected.

    * **Wallet Card:** Current point balance and "Send Points" button.
    * **Leaderboard:** Top 3 winners (visualized on a podium) followed by the ranking list.
    * **Store:** Redeeming points for features/items.
